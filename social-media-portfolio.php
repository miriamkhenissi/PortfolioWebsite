                <p>The following case study showcases some aspects of the though process behind a recent project of mine. The app has no launched but is still in Beta mode.<br/>
The project is a social media app that fights against bots and fake accounts. I worked closely with the client to get the branding & the look and feel of the platform right as well as unsure that the user has a smooth and straightforward journey navigating the app.</p>

                <h1 class="section-title">Research</h1>
                <p>When designing the screens and flow of the application, Instagram and Facebook were my top 2 inspirations. Millions of people use at least one of these apps on a daily basis and have become familiar to how it works, there’s no need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to simple and important components such as the navigation bars.  <br/>
The bottom navigation bar for my project included quick links to the top 5 areas of the app and was always visible on the screen except for the messaging area.
This was to allow extra space for users to view the chat as it’s frustrating to only see a couple of messages at a time and extra screen space becomes valuable at this stage.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Storyboarding</h2>
                <p>During the early stages of the project, I carried out storyboarding sessions with the client to give them an idea about the user flow and the main elements on the screen to gather feedback from them.<br/>s
During our first call, I focused on the 3 main flows: Signup, Create Post & Interacting with posts. Once the client was happy with these I moved on to the secondary flows. The process was very agile and the client was included in the decisions at every stage.
Once they were happy with the flow, we moved on to the XD designs where I used the mood boards provided by the client as inspiration. 
I presented them with several design iterations until they were happy with the final choice.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">Challenges</h2>
                <p class="mt-4">One of the main challenges for the app was the feed. I was faced by the opposition of keeping a clean feed that entices the user to read posts, while keeping each post short and simple to allow for more posts to be seen on the screen at one time.
                There was also the added complexity of having all of the controls relating to a user as well as the post itself.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-4">
                The solution was a clean card preview for each post that included the title, preview of content, the first image attached to the post as a backdrop, the author, post type and ellipses that expand to be controls.
                There are three different types of posts and I wanted the user to realise this at a glance, hence the different coloured overlays on each post type.
                <p/>
                <p class="mt-4">
                I included the swipe functionality to remove unwanted posts from the feed and added a modal to confirm the users choice as this is quite a destructive action.

                <h2 class="section-title">Design iterations</h2>
                <p>Being involved in the design process very early on allowed me to have a huge part in forming the brand and shaping the look and feel of the mobile application. Because the brand is novel, there were several iterations in the designs each time exploring different themes and visual languages.</p>
                <p>
With each iteration the brand became more clear and I worked closely with the client to take in the elements that they liked and avoid the ones they weren’t keen on, as well as applying best UI & UX practices to ensure a smooth journey for the end user.</p>
<p>

We didn't end up going with the following design as the client wanted softer colours to reflect the friendliness and warmth of the app</p>

                <h1 class="section-title">Adaptation</h1>
                <p>I adapted my designs to the app requirements as it evolved. A great example for this is the interests page that was originally only 10 choices. Towards the end of development, this changed to 40+ choices which required a review of the design.
I outsourced icons and modified them to fit in with the brand guidelines and created a container where users can scroll to select their interests.
I made sure to have the icons slightly cut off towards the end of the container and added a textual prompt so that users are aware of the number of choices available to them.</p>
