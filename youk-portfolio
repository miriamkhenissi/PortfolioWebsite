                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>One of the major characteristics of effective design is a clear user interface. All the elements need to be well-balanced and placed in the harmony. This could be achieved by the good use of ratios.
The golden ratio is a mathematical proportion between the elements of different sizes which is thought to be the most aes- thetically pleasing for human eyes. The golden ratio equals 1:1.618
Using the golden ratio in web design is mostly using the golden rectangle to determine how to place elements on the website.
I’ve applied the golden ratio to the product page to emphasize on the product image as well as the call to action which are both strategically placed to catch the eye.</p>

                <h2>Colour Palette</h2>
                <p>In order to achieve a minimalistic website that focuses more on the product images and the call to action buttons, I have created a very simple color palette consisting of three colors.<br/>
Using the visual balance of black and white with an accent color leads to powerful messaging and is a helpful strategy when drawing attention to a specific object and creating a visual “pop” which would be the product.Black and white sites do just that. By accenting certain parts of the page with a different color, they direct the viewer exactly where they want them to go.<br/>
I have chosen the accent color to be a bright gold which is the color of wealth, success and status. Associated with abundance and prosperity, luxury and quality, prestige and sophistication, value and elegance, the psychology of
this color implies affluence, material wealth and extravagance which aligns perfectly with our brands background.</p>
